class AggregatedListAcceleratorTypesRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for AcceleratorTypes.AggregatedList. See

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

class AggregatedListAddressesRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for Addresses.AggregatedList. See the
    method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do

class AggregatedListDiskTypesRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for DiskTypes.AggregatedList. See the
    method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for

            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.

class AggregatedListGlobalOperationsRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for GlobalOperations.AggregatedList. See
    the method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):

            added after this field, the flag has no effect

            visible scope for each scope type in response.

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

class AggregatedListInstanceGroupsRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for InstanceGroups.AggregatedList. See the
    method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):

            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

class AggregatedListMachineTypesRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for MachineTypes.AggregatedList. See the
    method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for

            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the

            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    See the method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions

class AggregatedListResourcePoliciesRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for ResourcePolicies.AggregatedList. See
    the method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

class AggregatedListServiceAttachmentsRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for ServiceAttachments.AggregatedList. See
    the method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for

            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.

            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

class AggregatedListSubnetworksRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for Subnetworks.AggregatedList. See the
    method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for

            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or

class AggregatedListTargetInstancesRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for TargetInstances.AggregatedList. See the
    method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for

            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.

            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for
            each scope type (zone, region, global) should be
            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the

            the next page of results.

            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for

            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            values are ARM64 or X86_64. Check the Architecture enum for
            the list of possible values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_architecture``.
        auto_delete (bool):
            Specifies whether the disk will be

            not when the disk is detached from the
            instance).

        boot (bool):
            Indicates that this is a boot disk. The

            reflected into the /dev/disk/by-id/google-\* tree of a Linux
            operating system running within the instance. This name can
            be used to reference the device for mounting, resizing, and

            in the form persistent-disk-x, where x is a number assigned
            by Google Compute Engine. This field is only applicable for
            persistent disks.

            creating a new disk, this field encrypts the new
            disk using an encryption key that you provide.
            If you are attaching an existing disk that is
            already encrypted, this field decrypts the disk
            using the customer-supplied encryption key. If
            you encrypt a disk using a customer-supplied
            key, you must provide the same key again when
            you attempt to use this resource at a later
            time. For example, you must provide the key when
            you create a snapshot or an image from the disk
            or when you attach the disk to a virtual machine
            instance. If you do not provide an encryption
            key, then the disk will be encrypted using an
            automatically generated key and you do not need
            to provide a key to use the disk later. Instance
            templates do not store customer-supplied
            encryption keys, so you cannot use your own keys
            to encrypt disks in a managed instance group.

            autoscaling and to determine whether the metric is exporting
            per-instance or per-group data. For the filter to be valid
            for autoscaling purposes, the following rules apply: - You
            can only use the AND operator for joining selectors. - You
            can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
            any functions for each selector. - You can specify the
            metric in both the filter string and in the metric field.
            However, if specified in both places, the metric must be
            identical. - The monitored resource type determines what
            kind of values are expected for the metric. If it is a
            gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a
            separate TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a
            case, you cannot filter on resource labels. If the resource
            type is any other value, the autoscaler expects this metric
            to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
            instance group and resource label filtering can be performed
            to point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
            This is called a *per-group metric* for the purpose of
            autoscaling. If not specified, the type defaults to
            gce_instance. Try to provide a filter that is selective
            enough to pick just one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group
            or for each of the instances (if you are using gce_instance
            resource type). If multiple TimeSeries are returned upon the
            query execution, the autoscaler will sum their respective
            values to obtain its scaling value.

        metric (str):
            The identifier (type) of the Stackdriver
            Monitoring metric. The metric cannot have
            negative values. The metric must have a value
            type of INT64 or DOUBLE.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_metric``.
        single_instance_assignment (float):
            If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that
            represents the total amount of work to be done or resource
            usage, set this value to an amount assigned for a single
            instance of the scaled group. Autoscaler keeps the number of
            instances proportional to the value of this metric. The
            metric itself does not change value due to group resizing. A
            good metric to use with the target is for example
            pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages
            or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests
            coming to your instances. A bad example would be a metric
            exporting an average or median latency, since this value
            can't include a chunk assignable to a single instance, it
            could be better used with utilization_target instead.

        utilization_target (float):
            The target value of the metric that autoscaler maintains.

            number of virtual machines handling requests to increase or
            decrease proportionally to the metric. For example, a good
            metric to use as a utilization_target is
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/instance/network/received_bytes_count.

    Attributes:
        bypass_cache_on_request_headers (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.BackendBucketCdnPolicyBypassCacheOnRequestHeader]):
            Bypass the cache when the specified request
            headers are matched - e.g. Pragma or
            Authorization headers. Up to 5 headers can be
            specified. The cache is bypassed for all
            cdnPolicy.cacheMode settings.
        cache_key_policy (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.BackendBucketCdnPolicyCacheKeyPolicy):
            The CacheKeyPolicy for this CdnPolicy.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_cache_key_policy``.
        cache_mode (str):
            Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this
            backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS
            Requires the origin to set valid caching headers to cache
            content. Responses without these headers will not be cached
            at Google's edge, and will require a full trip to the origin
            on every request, potentially impacting performance and
            increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache
            all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or
            "no-cache" directives in Cache-Control response headers.
            Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private,
            per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC
            Automatically cache static content, including common image
            formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript
            and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as
            uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML),
            will not be cached. Check the CacheMode enum for the list of
            possible values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_cache_mode``.
        client_ttl (int):
            Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum
            TTL. This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value
            sent to the client. With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of
            client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age
            directive, along with a "public" directive. For cacheable
            content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the
            max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the
            response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl
            and default_ttl, and also ensures a "public" cache-control
            directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a
            default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed
            value is 31,622,400s (1 year).

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_client_ttl``.
        default_ttl (int):
            Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this
            origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL
            (max-age or s-max-age). Setting a TTL of "0" means "always
            revalidate". The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a
            value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When
            the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will
            overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed
            value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently
            accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the
            defined TTL.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_default_ttl``.
        max_ttl (int):
            Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached
            content served by this origin. Cache directives
            that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher
            than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL
            seconds in the future will be capped at the
            value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an
            s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent
            to the client will not be modified. Setting a
            TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The
            maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year),
            noting that infrequently accessed objects may be
            evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_ttl``.
        negative_caching (bool):
            Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in
            order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or
            redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and
            improve end-user experience by reducing response latency.
            When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or
            USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses
            with the specified response code that lack any
            Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When
            the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching
            applies to all responses with the specified response code,
            and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will
            apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP
            300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m
            HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal
            Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected
            Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be
            overridden in negative_caching_policy.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_negative_caching``.
        negative_caching_policy (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.BackendBucketCdnPolicyNegativeCachingPolicy]):
            Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code.
            negative_caching must be enabled to configure
            negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving
            negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache
            TTLs. Note that when specifying an explicit
            negative_caching_policy, you should take care to specify a
            cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache.
            Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a
            policy exists.
        request_coalescing (bool):
            If true then Cloud CDN will combine multiple
            concurrent cache fill requests into a small
            number of requests to the origin.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_request_coalescing``.
        serve_while_stale (int):
            Serve existing content from the cache (if
            available) when revalidating content with the
            origin, or when an error is encountered when
            refreshing the cache. This setting defines the
            default "max-stale" duration for any cached
            responses that do not specify a max-stale
            directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL
            configured here will not be served. The default
            limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will
            allow stale content to be served up to this
            limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a
            cached response. The maximum allowed value is
            604800 (1 week). Set this to zero (0) to disable
            serve-while-stale.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_serve_while_stale``.
        signed_url_cache_max_age_sec (int):
            Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL
            request will be considered fresh. After this time period,
            the response will be revalidated before being served.
            Defaults to 1hr (3600s). When serving responses to signed
            URL requests, Cloud CDN will internally behave as though all
            responses from this backend had a "Cache-Control: public,
            max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any existing
            Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses
            will not be altered.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_signed_url_cache_max_age_sec``.
        signed_url_key_names (MutableSequence[str]):

class BackendService(proto.Message):
    r"""Represents a Backend Service resource. A backend service defines how
    Google Cloud load balancers distribute traffic. The backend service
    configuration contains a set of values, such as the protocol used to
    connect to backends, various distribution and session settings,
    health checks, and timeouts. These settings provide fine-grained
    control over how your load balancer behaves. Most of the settings
    have default values that allow for easy configuration if you need to
    get started quickly. Backend services in Google Compute Engine can
    be either regionally or globally scoped. \*

            round robin order. This is the default. - LEAST_REQUEST: An
            O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts and
            picks the host which has fewer active requests. - RING_HASH:
            The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
            hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
            addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only
            affects 1/N of the requests. - RANDOM: The load balancer
            selects a random healthy host. - ORIGINAL_DESTINATION:
            Backend host is selected based on the client connection
            metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address
            as the destination address of the incoming connection before
            the connection was redirected to the load balancer. -
            MAGLEV: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load
            balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has
            faster table lookup build times and host selection times.
            For more information about Maglev, see
            https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824 This field is
            applicable to either: - A regional backend service with the
            service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and
            load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED. - A global
            backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to
            INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. If sessionAffinity is not NONE, and
            this field is not set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH, session
            affinity settings will not take effect. Only ROUND_ROBIN and
            RING_HASH are supported when the backend service is
            referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy
            that has validateForProxyless field set to true. Check the
            LocalityLbPolicy enum for the list of possible values.

        max_stream_duration (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.Duration):
            Specifies the default maximum duration (timeout) for streams
            to this service. Duration is computed from the beginning of
            the stream until the response has been completely processed,
            including all retries. A stream that does not complete in
            this duration is closed. If not specified, there will be no
            timeout limit, i.e. the maximum duration is infinite. This
            value can be overridden in the PathMatcher configuration of
            the UrlMap that references this backend service. This field
            is only allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of the backend
            service is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

        cache_mode (str):
            Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this
            backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS
            Requires the origin to set valid caching headers to cache
            content. Responses without these headers will not be cached
            at Google's edge, and will require a full trip to the origin
            on every request, potentially impacting performance and
            increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache
            all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or
            "no-cache" directives in Cache-Control response headers.
            Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private,
            per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC
            Automatically cache static content, including common image
            formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript
            and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as
            uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML),
            will not be cached. Check the CacheMode enum for the list of
            possible values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_cache_mode``.
        client_ttl (int):
            Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum
            TTL. This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value
            sent to the client. With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of
            client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age
            directive, along with a "public" directive. For cacheable
            content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the
            max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the
            response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl
            and default_ttl, and also ensures a "public" cache-control
            directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a
            default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed
            value is 31,622,400s (1 year).

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_client_ttl``.
        default_ttl (int):
            Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this
            origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL
            (max-age or s-max-age). Setting a TTL of "0" means "always
            revalidate". The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a
            value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When
            the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will
            overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed
            value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently
            accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the
            defined TTL.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_default_ttl``.
        max_ttl (int):
            Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached
            content served by this origin. Cache directives
            that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher
            than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL
            seconds in the future will be capped at the
            value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an
            s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent
            to the client will not be modified. Setting a
            TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The
            maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year),
            noting that infrequently accessed objects may be
            evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_ttl``.
        negative_caching (bool):
            Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in
            order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or
            redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and
            improve end-user experience by reducing response latency.
            When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or
            USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses
            with the specified response code that lack any
            Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When
            the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching
            applies to all responses with the specified response code,
            and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will
            apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP
            300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m
            HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal
            Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected
            Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be
            overridden in negative_caching_policy.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_negative_caching``.
        negative_caching_policy (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.BackendServiceCdnPolicyNegativeCachingPolicy]):
            Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code.
            negative_caching must be enabled to configure
            negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving
            negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache
            TTLs. Note that when specifying an explicit
            negative_caching_policy, you should take care to specify a
            cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache.
            Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a
            policy exists.
        request_coalescing (bool):
            If true then Cloud CDN will combine multiple
            concurrent cache fill requests into a small
            number of requests to the origin.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_request_coalescing``.
        serve_while_stale (int):
            Serve existing content from the cache (if
            available) when revalidating content with the
            origin, or when an error is encountered when
            refreshing the cache. This setting defines the
            default "max-stale" duration for any cached
            responses that do not specify a max-stale
            directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL
            configured here will not be served. The default
            limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will
            allow stale content to be served up to this
            limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a

class Disk(proto.Message):
    r"""Represents a Persistent Disk resource. Google Compute Engine has two
    Disk resources: \* `Zonal </compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/disks>`__
    \* `Regional </compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionDisks>`__
    Persistent disks are required for running your VM instances. Create
    both boot and non-boot (data) persistent disks. For more
    information, read Persistent Disks. For more storage options, read
    Storage options. The disks resource represents a zonal persistent
    disk. For more information, read Zonal persistent disks. The
    regionDisks resource represents a regional persistent disk. For more
    information, read Regional resources.

    Attributes:
        architecture (str):
            The architecture of the disk. Valid values are ARM64 or
            X86_64. Check the Architecture enum for the list of possible
            values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_architecture``.
        creation_timestamp (str):
            [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_creation_timestamp``.
        description (str):
            An optional description of this resource.
            Provide this property when you create the
            resource.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_description``.
        disk_encryption_key (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.CustomerEncryptionKey):
            Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key
            or a customer-managed encryption key. Encryption keys do not
            protect access to metadata of the disk. After you encrypt a
            disk with a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same
            key if you use the disk later. For example, to create a disk
            snapshot, to create a disk image, to create a machine image,
            or to attach the disk to a virtual machine. After you
            encrypt a disk with a customer-managed key, the
            diskEncryptionKey.kmsKeyName is set to a key *version* name
            once the disk is created. The disk is encrypted with this
            version of the key. In the response,
            diskEncryptionKey.kmsKeyName appears in the following
            format: "diskEncryptionKey.kmsKeyName":
            "projects/kms_project_id/locations/region/keyRings/
            key_region/cryptoKeys/key /cryptoKeysVersions/version If you
            do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk,
            then the disk is encrypted using an automatically generated
            key and you don't need to provide a key to use the disk
            later.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_disk_encryption_key``.
        guest_os_features (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.GuestOsFeature]):
            A list of features to enable on the guest
            operating system. Applicable only for bootable
            images. Read Enabling guest operating system
            features to see a list of available options.

            [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#disk for
            disks.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_kind``.
        label_fingerprint (str):
            A fingerprint for the labels being applied to
            this disk, which is essentially a hash of the
            labels set used for optimistic locking. The
            fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
            Engine and changes after every request to modify
            or update labels. You must always provide an
            up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update
            or change labels, otherwise the request will
            fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the
            latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
            retrieve a disk.

            resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
            and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
            characters long and match the regular expression
            ``[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`` which means the first
            character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
            characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
            except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

            Alternatively, use a specific version of a
            public operating system image:
            projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-vYYYYMMDD
            To create a disk with a custom image that you
            created, specify the image name in the following
            format: global/images/my-custom-image You can
            also specify a custom image by its image family,
            which returns the latest version of the image in
            that family. Replace the image name with
            family/family-name:
            global/images/family/my-image-family

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_source_image``.
        source_image_encryption_key (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.CustomerEncryptionKey):

            persistent disk from an image that was later deleted and
            recreated under the same name, the source image ID would
            identify the exact version of the image that was used.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_source_image_id``.
        source_snapshot (str):
            The source snapshot used to create this disk.

        source_snapshot_id (str):
            [Output Only] The unique ID of the snapshot used to create
            this disk. This value identifies the exact snapshot that was
            used to create this persistent disk. For example, if you
            created the persistent disk from a snapshot that was later
            deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
            snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot
            that was used.

        description (str):
            An optional description of this resource.
            Provide this field when you create the resource.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_description``.
        destination_ranges (MutableSequence[str]):
            If destination ranges are specified, the
            firewall rule applies only to traffic that has
            destination IP address in these ranges. These
            ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. Both
            IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.
        direction (str):
            Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies, either
            ``INGRESS`` or ``EGRESS``. The default is ``INGRESS``. For
            ``EGRESS`` traffic, you cannot specify the sourceTags
            fields. Check the Direction enum for the list of possible
            values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_direction``.
        disabled (bool):
            Denotes whether the firewall rule is
            disabled. When set to true, the firewall rule is
            not enforced and the network behaves as if it
            did not exist. If this is unspecified, the
            firewall rule will be enabled.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_disabled``.
        id (int):
            [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This
            identifier is defined by the server.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_id``.
        kind (str):
            [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#firewall

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_kind``.
        log_config (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.FirewallLogConfig):
            This field denotes the logging options for a
            particular firewall rule. If logging is enabled,
            logs will be exported to Cloud Logging.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_log_config``.
        name (str):
            Name of the resource; provided by the client when the
            resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
            and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
            characters long and match the regular expression
            ``[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?``. The first character must be
            a lowercase letter, and all following characters (except for
            the last character) must be a dash, lowercase letter, or
            digit. The last character must be a lowercase letter or
            digit.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_name``.
        network (str):
            URL of the network resource for this firewall
            rule. If not specified when creating a firewall
            rule, the default network is used:
            global/networks/default If you choose to specify
            this field, you can specify the network as a
            full or partial URL. For example, the following
            are all valid URLs: -
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network
            - projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network
            - global/networks/default

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_network``.
        priority (int):
            Priority for this rule. This is an integer between ``0`` and
            ``65535``, both inclusive. The default value is ``1000``.
            Relative priorities determine which rule takes effect if
            multiple rules apply. Lower values indicate higher priority.
            For example, a rule with priority ``0`` has higher
            precedence than a rule with priority ``1``. DENY rules take
            precedence over ALLOW rules if they have equal priority.
            Note that VPC networks have implied rules with a priority of
            ``65535``. To avoid conflicts with the implied rules, use a
            priority number less than ``65535``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_priority``.
        self_link (str):
            [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_self_link``.
        source_ranges (MutableSequence[str]):
            If source ranges are specified, the firewall
            rule applies only to traffic that has a source
            IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be
            expressed in CIDR format. One or both of
            sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both
            fields are set, the rule applies to traffic that
            has a source IP address within sourceRanges OR a
            source IP from a resource with a matching tag
            listed in the sourceTags field. The connection
            does not need to match both fields for the rule
            to apply. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.
        source_service_accounts (MutableSequence[str]):
            If source service accounts are specified, the
            firewall rules apply only to traffic originating
            from an instance with a service account in this
            list. Source service accounts cannot be used to
            control traffic to an instance's external IP
            address because service accounts are associated
            with an instance, not an IP address.
            sourceRanges can be set at the same time as
            sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the
            firewall applies to traffic that has a source IP
            address within the sourceRanges OR a source IP
            that belongs to an instance with service account
            listed in sourceServiceAccount. The connection
            does not need to match both fields for the
            firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot
            be used at the same time as sourceTags or
            targetTags.
        source_tags (MutableSequence[str]):
            If source tags are specified, the firewall
            rule applies only to traffic with source IPs
            that match the primary network interfaces of VM
            instances that have the tag and are in the same
            VPC network. Source tags cannot be used to
            control traffic to an instance's external IP
            address, it only applies to traffic between
            instances in the same virtual network. Because
            tags are associated with instances, not IP
            addresses. One or both of sourceRanges and
            sourceTags may be set. If both fields are set,
            the firewall applies to traffic that has a
            source IP address within sourceRanges OR a
            source IP from a resource with a matching tag
            listed in the sourceTags field. The connection
            does not need to match both fields for the
            firewall to apply.
        target_service_accounts (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances
            located in the network that may make network connections as
            specified in allowed[]. targetServiceAccounts cannot be used
            at the same time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither
            targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are specified, the
            firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified
            network.
        target_tags (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of tags that controls which instances
            the firewall rule applies to. If targetTags are
            specified, then the firewall rule applies only
            to instances in the VPC network that have one of
            those tags. If no targetTags are specified, the
            firewall rule applies to all instances on the
            specified network.

    Forwarding rule concepts and Using protocol forwarding.

    Attributes:
        I_p_address (str):
            IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic.
            When a client sends traffic to this IP address, the
            forwarding rule directs the traffic to the referenced target
            or backendService. While creating a forwarding rule,
            specifying an IPAddress is required under the following
            circumstances: - When the target is set to targetGrpcProxy
            and validateForProxyless is set to true, the IPAddress
            should be set to 0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private
            Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an
            IPAddress. Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP
            address that references an existing static (reserved) IP
            address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an
            ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to
            specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: \*
            IP address number, as in ``100.1.2.3`` \* IPv6 address
            range, as in ``2600:1234::/96`` \* Full resource URL, as in

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_load_balancing_scheme``.
        metadata_filters (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.MetadataFilter]):
            Opaque filter criteria used by load balancer to restrict
            routing configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant
            clients. In their xDS requests to load balancer, xDS clients
            present node metadata. When there is a match, the relevant
            configuration is made available to those proxies. Otherwise,
            all the resources (e.g. TargetHttpProxy, UrlMap) referenced
            by the ForwardingRule are not visible to those proxies. For
            each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria
            is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must
            match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If
            its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its
            filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided
            in the metadata. If multiple metadataFilters are specified,
            all of them need to be satisfied in order to be considered a
            match. metadataFilters specified here will be applifed
            before those specified in the UrlMap that this
            ForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies to
            Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to
            INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
        name (str):
            Name of the resource; provided by the client when the
            resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
            and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
            characters long and match the regular expression
            ``[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`` which means the first
            character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
            characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
            except the last character, which cannot be a dash. For
            Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward
            traffic to Google APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a
            1-20 characters string with lowercase letters and numbers

class GetNatMappingInfoRoutersRequest(proto.Message):

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

        page_token (str):

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

        order_by (str):

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            if the instance or endpoint does not respond at all. For
            example, disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection
            failure, and refused streams. - gateway-error: Similar to
            5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504. -
            connect-failure: a retry is attempted on failures connecting
            to the instance or endpoint. For example, connection
            timeouts. - retriable-4xx: a retry is attempted if the
            instance or endpoint responds with a 4xx response code. The
            only error that you can retry is error code 409. -
            refused-stream: a retry is attempted if the instance or
            endpoint resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code.
            This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry. -
            cancelled: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in
            the response header is set to cancelled. -
            deadline-exceeded: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status
            code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded. -
            internal: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in

            semantics: the request matches this routeRule
            when any of the matchRules are satisfied.
            However predicates within a given matchRule have
            AND semantics. All predicates within a matchRule

        priority (int):
            For routeRules within a given pathMatcher,
            priority determines the order in which a load

            evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest
            to highest number. The priority of a rule
            decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3,

class Image(proto.Message):
    r"""Represents an Image resource. You can use images to create
    boot disks for your VM instances. For more information, read
    Images.

    Attributes:
        architecture (str):
            The architecture of the image. Valid values are ARM64 or
            X86_64. Check the Architecture enum for the list of possible
            values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_architecture``.
        archive_size_bytes (int):
            Size of the image tar.gz archive stored in
            Google Cloud Storage (in bytes).

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_archive_size_bytes``.
        creation_timestamp (str):
            [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_creation_timestamp``.
        deprecated (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.DeprecationStatus):
            The deprecation status associated with this
            image.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_deprecated``.
        description (str):
            An optional description of this resource.
            Provide this property when you create the
            resource.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_description``.
        disk_size_gb (int):
            Size of the image when restored onto a
            persistent disk (in GB).

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_disk_size_gb``.
        family (str):
            The name of the image family to which this
            image belongs. You can create disks by
            specifying an image family instead of a specific
            image name. The image family always returns its
            latest image that is not deprecated. The name of
            the image family must comply with RFC1035.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_family``.
        guest_os_features (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.GuestOsFeature]):
            A list of features to enable on the guest operating system.

            available options, see the guestOSfeatures[].type parameter.
        id (int):
            [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This
            identifier is defined by the server.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_id``.
        image_encryption_key (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.CustomerEncryptionKey):
            Encrypts the image using a customer-supplied
            encryption key. After you encrypt an image with
            a customer-supplied key, you must provide the
            same key if you use the image later (e.g. to
            create a disk from the image). Customer-supplied
            encryption keys do not protect access to
            metadata of the disk. If you do not provide an
            encryption key when creating the image, then the
            disk will be encrypted using an automatically
            generated key and you do not need to provide a
            key to use the image later.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_image_encryption_key``.
        kind (str):
            [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#image for
            images.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_kind``.
        label_fingerprint (str):
            A fingerprint for the labels being applied to
            this image, which is essentially a hash of the
            labels used for optimistic locking. The
            fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
            Engine and changes after every request to modify
            or update labels. You must always provide an
            up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update
            or change labels, otherwise the request will
            fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the
            latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
            retrieve an image.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_label_fingerprint``.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Labels to apply to this image. These can be
            later modified by the setLabels method.
        license_codes (MutableSequence[int]):
            Integer license codes indicating which
            licenses are attached to this image.
        licenses (MutableSequence[str]):
            Any applicable license URI.
        name (str):
            Name of the resource; provided by the client when the
            resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
            and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
            characters long and match the regular expression
            ``[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`` which means the first
            character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
            characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
            except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_name``.
        raw_disk (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.RawDisk):
            The parameters of the raw disk image.

        target_size (int):
            The target number of running instances for
            this managed instance group. You can reduce this
            number by using the instanceGroupManager
            deleteInstances or abandonInstances methods.
            Resizing the group also changes this number.

            top-level instanceTemplate field. Read more
            about the relationships between these fields.
            Exactly one version must leave the targetSize
            field unset. That version will be applied to all
            remaining instances. For more information, read
            about canary updates.
        zone (str):
            [Output Only] The URL of a zone where the managed instance

            Possible values are: - NONE - This is the default value,
            which means that the VLAN attachment carries unencrypted
            traffic. VMs are able to send traffic to, or receive traffic
            from, such a VLAN attachment. - IPSEC - The VLAN attachment
            carries only encrypted traffic that is encrypted by an IPsec
            device, such as an HA VPN gateway or third-party IPsec VPN.

            the VLAN attachment that has the encryption
            option as IPSEC. The addresses must be regional
            internal IP address ranges. When creating an HA
            VPN gateway over the VLAN attachment, if the
            attachment is configured to use a regional
            internal IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP
            address is allocated from the IP address range
            specified here. For example, if the HA VPN
            gateway's interface 0 is paired to this VLAN
            attachment, then a regional internal IP address
            for the VPN gateway interface 0 will be
            allocated from the IP address specified for this
            VLAN attachment. If this field is not specified
            when creating the VLAN attachment, then later on
            when creating an HA VPN gateway on this VLAN
            attachment, the HA VPN gateway's IP address is
            allocated from the regional external IP address
            pool. Not currently available publicly.

class ListAcceleratorTypesRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for AcceleratorTypes.List. See the method
    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

    r"""A request message for DiskTypes.List. See the method
    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use

class ListErrorsRegionInstanceGroupManagersRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for RegionInstanceGroupManagers.ListErrors.
    See the method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        instance_group_manager (str):
            The name of the managed instance group. It must be a string
            that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an unsigned long
            integer: must match regexp pattern:
            (?:`a-z <?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9]>`__?)|1-9{0,19}.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the
            ``nextPageToken`` returned by a previous list request to get
            the next page of results.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_page_token``.
        project (str):
            Project ID for this request.
        region (str):
            Name of the region scoping this request. This
            should conform to RFC1035.
        return_partial_success (bool):
            Opt-in for partial success behavior which
            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_return_partial_success``.

            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``

            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use

    r"""A request message for ForwardingRules.List. See the method
    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            that can be used to get the next page of results in

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use

            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

class ListInstancesRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for Instances.List. See the method
    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be

            that can be used to get the next page of results in

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    r"""A request message for
    InstanceGroupManagers.ListManagedInstances. See the method
    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            network endpoints. It should comply with
            RFC1035.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``

class ListNodesNodeGroupsRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for NodeGroups.ListNodes. See the method
    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

        max_results (int):

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or

            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

class ListPublicDelegatedPrefixesRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for PublicDelegatedPrefixes.List. See the
    method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

    r"""A request message for RegionBackendServices.List. See the
    method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

class ListRegionHealthCheckServicesRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for RegionHealthCheckServices.List. See the
    method description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use

    r"""A request message for RegionInstanceGroups.List. See the

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or

class ListRegionOperationsRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for RegionOperations.List. See the method
    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

    r"""A request message for RegionSslPolicies.List. See the method
    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use

    r"""A request message for ResourcePolicies.List. See the method
    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on

class ListUsableSubnetworksRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for Subnetworks.ListUsable. See the method
    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

class ListZoneOperationsRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A request message for ZoneOperations.List. See the method
    description for details.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must
            specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you
            want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
            number, or a boolean. The operator must be either ``=``,
            ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``. For example,
            if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
            exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by specifying
            ``name != example-instance``. The ``:`` operator can be used
            with string fields to match substrings. For non-string
            fields it is equivalent to the ``=`` operator. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``.

class Policy(proto.Message):
    r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies
    access controls for Google Cloud resources. A ``Policy`` is a
    collection of ``bindings``. A ``binding`` binds one or more
    ``members``, or principals, to a single ``role``. Principals can be
    user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as
    G Suite). A ``role`` is a named list of permissions; each ``role``
    can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For
    some types of Google Cloud resources, a ``binding`` can also specify
    a ``condition``, which is a logical expression that allows access to
    a resource only if the expression evaluates to ``true``. A condition
    can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
    resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in
    their IAM policies, see the `IAM
    documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.

        audit_configs (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.AuditConfig]):
            Specifies cloud audit logging configuration
            for this policy.
        bindings (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.Binding]):
            Associates a list of ``members``, or principals, with a
            ``role``. Optionally, may specify a ``condition`` that
            determines how and when the ``bindings`` are applied. Each
            of the ``bindings`` must contain at least one principal. The
            ``bindings`` in a ``Policy`` can refer to up to 1,500
            principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these
            limits. For example, if the ``bindings`` grant 50 different
            roles to ``user:alice@example.com``, and not to any other
            principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the
            ``bindings`` in the ``Policy``.
        etag (str):
            ``etag`` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way
            to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from
            overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that
            systems make use of the ``etag`` in the read-modify-write
            cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
            conditions: An ``etag`` is returned in the response to
            ``getIamPolicy``, and systems are expected to put that etag
            in the request to ``setIamPolicy`` to ensure that their
            change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
            **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include
            the ``etag`` field whenever you call ``setIamPolicy``. If
            you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a
            version ``3`` policy with a version ``1`` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version ``3`` policy are lost.

        version (int):
            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are ``0``,
            ``1``, and ``3``. Requests that specify an invalid value are
            rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role
            bindings must specify version ``3``. This requirement
            applies to the following operations: \* Getting a policy
            that includes a conditional role binding \* Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy \* Changing a
            conditional role binding in a policy \* Removing any role
            binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that
            includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
            Conditions, you must include the ``etag`` field whenever you
            call ``setIamPolicy``. If you omit this field, then IAM
            allows you to overwrite a version ``3`` policy with a
            version ``1`` policy, and all of the conditions in the
            version ``3`` policy are lost. If a policy does not include
            any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any
            valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

            Specifies a fingerprint for this resource,
            which is essentially a hash of the metadata's
            contents and used for optimistic locking. The
            fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
            Engine and changes after every request to modify
            or update metadata. You must always provide an
            up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update
            or change metadata, otherwise the request will
            fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the

            Name of the BackendService resource to which
            the edge security policy should be set. The name
            should conform to RFC1035.

        request_id (str):
            An optional request ID to identify requests.
            Specify a unique request ID so that if you must
            retry your request, the server will know to
            ignore the request if it has already been
            completed. For example, consider a situation
            where you make an initial request and the
            request times out. If you make the request again
            with the same request ID, the server can check
            if original operation with the same request ID
            was received, and if so, will ignore the second
            request. This prevents clients from accidentally
            creating duplicate commitments. The request ID

            configure Envoy as a gateway or middle proxy (in other
            words, not a sidecar proxy). The Envoy proxy listens for
            inbound requests and handles requests when it receives them.
