                A ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members`` to a single
                ``role``. Members can be user accounts, service
                accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite).
                A ``role`` is a named list of permissions; each ``role``
                can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom
                role.

                For some types of Google Cloud resources, a ``binding``
                can also specify a ``condition``, which is a logical
                expression that allows access to a resource only if the
                expression evaluates to ``true``. A condition can add
                constraints based on attributes of the request, the

                conditions in their IAM policies, see the `IAM
                documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.

                Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources:

                   `Zonal </compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/zoneOperations>`__

                You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous
                API requests. For more information, read Handling API
                responses.

                Operations can be global, regional or zonal.

                -  For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                   resource.
                -  For regional operations, use the ``regionOperations``
                   resource.
                -  For zonal operations, use the ``zonalOperations``
                   resource.
