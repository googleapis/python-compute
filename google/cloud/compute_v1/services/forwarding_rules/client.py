                This corresponds to the ``project`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            region (str):
                Name of the region scoping this
                request.

                This corresponds to the ``region`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            forwarding_rule (str):
                Name of the ForwardingRule resource
                in which target is to be set.

                This corresponds to the ``forwarding_rule`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            target_reference_resource (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.TargetReference):
                The body resource for this request
                This corresponds to the ``target_reference_resource`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:
