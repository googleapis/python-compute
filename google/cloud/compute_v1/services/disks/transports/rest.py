                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:
            ~.compute.Policy:
                An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which
                specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources.

                A ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members`` to a single
                ``role``. Members can be user accounts, service
                accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite).
                A ``role`` is a named list of permissions; each ``role``
                can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom
                role.

                For some types of Google Cloud resources, a ``binding``
                can also specify a ``condition``, which is a logical
                expression that allows access to a resource only if the
                expression evaluates to ``true``. A condition can add
                constraints based on attributes of the request, the
                resource, or both. To learn which resources support
                conditions in their IAM policies, see the `IAM
                documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.

                **JSON example:**

                { "bindings": [ { "role":
                "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
                "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com",
                "domain:google.com",
                "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
                ] }, { "role":
                "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
                "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title":

                "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 }

                **YAML example:**

                bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com -
                group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com -
                serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
                role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members:
                - user:eve@example.com role:

                Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
