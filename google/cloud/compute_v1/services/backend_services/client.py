                   A backend service defines how Google Cloud load
                   balancers distribute traffic. The backend service
                   configuration contains a set of values, such as the
                   protocol used to connect to backends, various
                   distribution and session settings, health checks, and
                   timeouts. These settings provide fine-grained control
                   over how your load balancer behaves. Most of the
                   settings have default values that allow for easy
                   configuration if you need to get started quickly.

                   Backend services in Google Compute Engine can be

        see Backend services overview.

        Args:
            request (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.UpdateBackendServiceRequest):
                The request object. A request message for
                BackendServices.Update. See the method description for
                details.
            project (str):
                Project ID for this request.
                This corresponds to the ``project`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            backend_service (str):
                Name of the BackendService resource
                to update.

                This corresponds to the ``backend_service`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            backend_service_resource (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.BackendService):
                The body resource for this request
                This corresponds to the ``backend_service_resource`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:
            google.cloud.compute_v1.types.Operation:
                Represents an Operation resource.

                   Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources:

                   -  [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/globalOperations)
                      \*
                      [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/regionOperations)
                      \*
                      [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/zoneOperations)

                   You can use an operation resource to manage
                   asynchronous API requests. For more information, read
                   Handling API responses.

                   Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For
                   global operations, use the globalOperations resource.
                   - For regional operations, use the regionOperations
                   resource. - For zonal operations, use the
                   zonalOperations resource.

                   For more information, read Global, Regional, and
                   Zonal Resources. (== resource_for
