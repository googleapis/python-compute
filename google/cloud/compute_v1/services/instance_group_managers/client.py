                      [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/zoneOperations)

                   You can use an operation resource to manage
                   asynchronous API requests. For more information, read
                   Handling API responses.

                   Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For
                   global operations, use the globalOperations resource.
                   - For regional operations, use the regionOperations
                   resource. - For zonal operations, use the
                   zonalOperations resource.
