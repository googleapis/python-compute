                specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A
                Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds one
                or more members, or principals, to a single role.
                Principals can be user accounts, service accounts,
                Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is
                a named list of permissions; each role can be an IAM
                predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some
                types of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also
                specify a condition, which is a logical expression that
                allows access to a resource only if the expression
                evaluates to true. A condition can add constraints based
                on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
                learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
                policies, see the [IAM
                documentation](\ https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

                Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds one
                or more members, or principals, to a single role.
                Principals can be user accounts, service accounts,
                Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is
                a named list of permissions; each role can be an IAM
                predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some
                types of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also
                specify a condition, which is a logical expression that
                allows access to a resource only if the expression
                evaluates to true. A condition can add constraints based
                on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
                learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
                policies, see the [IAM
                documentation](\ https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
