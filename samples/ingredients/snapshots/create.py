    Create a snapshot of a disk.

    You need to pass `zone` or `region` parameter relevant to the disk you want to
    snapshot, but not both. Pass `zone` parameter for zonal disks and `region` for
    regional disks.

    Args:
        project_id: project ID or project number of the Cloud project you want
            to use to store the snapshot.
        disk_name: name of the disk you want to snapshot.
        snapshot_name: name of the snapshot to be created.
        zone: name of the zone in which is the disk you want to snapshot (for zonal disks).
        region: name of the region in which is the disk you want to snapshot (for regional disks).
        location: The Cloud Storage multi-region or the Cloud Storage region where you
            want to store your snapshot.
            You can specify only one storage location. Available locations:
            https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#available-locations
        disk_project_id: project ID or project number of the Cloud project that
            hosts the disk you want to snapshot. If not provided, will look for
            the disk in the `project_id` project.

    Returns:
        The new snapshot instance.
