    """
    Creates a new Windows Server instance that has only an internal IP address.

    Args:
        project_id: project ID or project number of the Cloud project you want to use.
        zone: name of the zone to create the instance in. For example: "us-west3-b"
        instance_name: name of the new virtual machine (VM) instance.
        machine_type: machine type you want to create in following format:
            "zones/{zone}/machineTypes/{type_name}". For example:
            "zones/europe-west3-c/machineTypes/f1-micro"
            You can find the list of available machine types using:
            https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/machine-types/list
        source_image_family: name of the public image family for Windows Server or SQL Server images.
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images#os-compute-support
        network_link: name of the network you want the new instance to use.
            For example: "global/networks/default" represents the network
            named "default", which is created automatically for each project.
        subnetwork_link: name of the subnetwork you want the new instance to use.
            This value uses the following format:
           "regions/{region}/subnetworks/{subnetwork_name}"

    Returns:
        Instance object.
