    Creates a copy of another image.

    Args:
        project_id: project ID or project number of the Cloud project you want to place your new image in.
        source_image_name: name of the image you want to copy.
        image_name: name of the image you want to create.
        source_project_id: name of the project that hosts the source image. If left unset, it's assumed to equal
            the `project_id`.
        guest_os_features: an iterable collection of guest features you want to enable for the bootable image.
            Learn more about Guest OS features here:
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/create-delete-deprecate-private-images#guest-os-features
        storage_location: the storage location of your image. For example, specify "us" to store the image in the
            `us` multi-region, or "us-central1" to store it in the `us-central1` region. If you do not make a selection,
             Compute Engine stores the image in the multi-region closest to your image's source location.

    Returns:
        An Image object.
