    Modify the deprecation status of an image.

    Note: Image objects by default don't have the `deprecated` attribute at all, until it's set.

    Args:
        project_id: project ID or project number of the Cloud project that hosts the image.
        image_name: name of the image you want to modify
        status: the status you want to set for the image. Available values are available in
            `compute_v1.DeprecationStatus.State` enum. Learn more about image deprecation statuses:
