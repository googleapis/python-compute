    Create a new route in selected network by providing a destination and next hop name.

    Note: The set of {next_hop_gateway, next_hop_ip, next_hop_instance, next_hop_vpn_tunnel,
        next_hop_ilb} is exclusive, you and only specify one of those parameters.

    Args:
        project_id: project ID or project number of the Cloud project you want to use.
        network: name of the network the route will be created in. Available name formats:
            * https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project_id}/global/networks/{network}
            * projects/{project_id}/global/networks/{network}
            * global/networks/{network}
        route_name: name of the new route.
        destination_range: range of destination IPs this route should be applied to. E.g. 10.0.0.0/16.
        next_hop_gateway: name of the gateway the traffic should be directed to.
        next_hop_ip: IP address the traffic should be directed to.
        next_hop_instance: name of the instance the traffic should be directed to. Name format:
            "projects/{project}/zones/{zone}/instances/{instance_name}"
        next_hop_vpn_tunnel: name of the VPN tunnel the traffic should be directed to. Name format:

        next_hop_ilb: name of a forwarding rule of the Internal Load Balancer the traffic
