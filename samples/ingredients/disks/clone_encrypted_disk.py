    """
    Creates a zonal non-boot persistent disk in a project with the copy of data from an existing disk.

    The encryption key must be the same for the source disk and the new disk.

    Args:
        project_id: project ID or project number of the Cloud project you want to use.
        zone: name of the zone in which you want to create the disk.
        disk_name: name of the disk you want to create.
        disk_type: the type of disk you want to create. This value uses the following format:
            "zones/{zone}/diskTypes/(pd-standard|pd-ssd|pd-balanced|pd-extreme)".
            For example: "zones/us-west3-b/diskTypes/pd-ssd"
        disk_size_gb: size of the new disk in gigabytes
        disk_link: a link to the disk you want to use as a source for the new disk.
            This value uses the following format: "projects/{project_name}/zones/{zone}/disks/{disk_name}"
        encryption_key: customer-supplied encryption key used for encrypting
            data in the source disk. The data will be encrypted with the same key
            in the new disk.

    Returns:
        An attachable copy of an existing disk.
