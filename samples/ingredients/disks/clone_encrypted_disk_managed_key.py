    """
    Creates a zonal non-boot disk in a project with the copy of data from an existing disk.

    The encryption key must be the same for the source disk and the new disk.

    Args:
        project_id: project ID or project number of the Cloud project you want to use.
        zone: name of the zone in which you want to create the disk.
        disk_name: name of the disk you want to create.
        disk_type: the type of disk you want to create. This value uses the following format:
            "zones/{zone}/diskTypes/(pd-standard|pd-ssd|pd-balanced|pd-extreme)".
            For example: "zones/us-west3-b/diskTypes/pd-ssd"
        disk_size_gb: size of the new disk in gigabytes
        disk_link: a link to the disk you want to use as a source for the new disk.
            This value uses the following format: "projects/{project_name}/zones/{zone}/disks/{disk_name}"
        kms_key_name: URL of the key from KMS. The key might be from another project, as
            long as you have access to it. The data will be encrypted with the same key
            in the new disk. This value uses following format:
            "projects/{kms_project_id}/locations/{region}/keyRings/{key_ring}/cryptoKeys/{key}"

    Returns:
        An attachable copy of an existing disk.
